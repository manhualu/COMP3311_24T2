Q2. Why do we want to data model?
We want to: 
    - Take in the requirements given by a client 
    - Build a description of the entities and its attributes
    - Show the relationship between these entities

The model should ensure all requirements are met. 

Ideally, the model should give enough detail about the database schema so that it can be created without additional information.
